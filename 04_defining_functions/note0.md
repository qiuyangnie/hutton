# Defining functions

##Â New from old
Perhaps the most straightforward way to define new functions is simply by combining one or more existing functions. For example, a few library functions that can be defined in this way are shown below.

```Haskell
-- Decide if an integer is even:
even :: Integral a => a -> Bool
even n = n `mod` 2 == 0

-- Split a list at the nth element:
splitAt :: Int -> [a] -> ([a],[a])
splitAt n xs = (take n xs, drop n xs)

-- Reciprocation:
recip :: Fractional a => a -> a
recip n = 1/n
```
